<h1 align="center">MOS Test</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    In this part, you will be asked to grade 20 group of samples from a score of 1 to a score of 5. Some audios will
    hold artifacts that we introduced in the tutorial part. Remember to focus more on these artifacts and be more
    rational when judging audio.
</p>

<h2>
    Grading Examples for Singing Voice
</h2>
<p>
    Listen to the following audio and rate it for quality. Some of the audio samples you will hear are of high
    quality, but some of them may sound artificial due to deterioration caused by computer processing. Please
    evaluate the voice quality on a scale of 1 to 5.
</p>

<h3>
    This is the ground truth audio which should be graded as "5".
</h3>

<div align="center">
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/gt.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not be
        loaded</audio>

<div>
    <form method="post">
        <ul class="movie-list">
            <li><input type="radio" name="quality" value="5"> 5</li>
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>

<h3>
    In this case, the audio should be graded around "4.5". Although it sounds stable and clear, it still lacks of
    high-frequency components.
</h3>

<div align="center">
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/hifigan_merge.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not
        be loaded</audio>
</div>

<div>
    <form method="post">
        <ul class="movie-list">
            <li><input type="radio" name="quality" value="4"> 4.5</li>
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>

<h3>
    In this case, the audio should be graded around "4". Although it does not have any aliasing artifacts, there
    exists
    some phase distortions in the audio that can be perceived as hoarse sounds.
</h3>

<div align="center">
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/bigvgan_merge.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not
        be
        loaded</audio>

    <form method="post">
        <ul class="movie-list">
            <li><input type="radio" name="quality" value="5"> 4</li>
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>

<h3>
    In this case, the audio should be graded around "3.5". It losses most of the high-frequency components and has some
    audible artifacts, glitches in the low-frequency parts.
</h3>

<div align="center">
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/hifigan_stft.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not
        be loaded</audio>

            <li><input type="radio" name="quality" value="4"> 3.5</li>
        </ul>
    </form>
</div>

<h3>
    In this case, the audio should be graded below or equal to "3". Since it holds a lot of problems. It is unstable in
    voicing
    energy and has some "gaps" between
    utterances.
</h3>

<div align="center">
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/melgan_merge.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not
        be loaded</audio>

            <li><input type="radio" name="quality" value="4"> 3 or 2.x </li>
        </ul>
