<h1 align="center">Preference Test</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    In this part, you will be displayed to 18 group of samples. You need to choose your preference audio in each group
    with the gorund truth as the reference. Some audios will
    hold artifacts that we introduced in the tutorial part. Remember to focus more on these artifacts and be more
    rational when judging audio.
</p>

<h2>
    Example
</h2>
<h3>
    In this case, the first audio sample is stable at the fundamental frequency. However, it cannot reconstruct the mid
    and high-frequency parts, resulting in annoying noise. The second audio sample, in the meantime, alleviated the
    noise problem. Although the second audio is unstable in energy and pitch, it still holds a better overall quality
    than the first.
</h3>

<p>
    Here is the ground truth audio for reference.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <!-- Note: the src path could be confusing! See the URL for hints! -->
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/gt.wav') }}" controls="controls">{{wav_file_gt}} can not
        be loaded</audio>
</div>

<p>
    Listen to the following two audio samples and choose your preferred one.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <!-- Note: the src path could be confusing! -->
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/melgan_orig.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not be
        loaded</audio>
    <audio src="{{ url_for('static', filename='audios/example/melgan_merge.wav') }}" controls="controls">wav can not be
        loaded</audio>
</div>

<ul class="movie-list">
    <li><input type="radio" name="preference" value="1"> The second one is better.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <h3>
    In this case, both the two audios hold excellent quality. But if we listen to their details, we will find that the
    second audio has some high-frequency noise, and it also enlarges the mouth clicks(neng <i>bu</i> neng <i>gei</i> wo
    yi shou ge de shi jian). Thus the first audio sample is better.
