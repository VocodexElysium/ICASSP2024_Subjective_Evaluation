<h2>Section 1</h2>

In this section, there will be a tutorial part and a MOS test.

<br>
<br>

<b>Tutorial</b>: In this part, you will learn some general artifacts in audio generation, including the aliasing
problem, the periodicity mismatch problem, etc. These problems are easy to understand and identify in an audio file.

<br>
<br>

<b>MOS test</b>: In this part, you will be asked to grade 20 samples from a score of 1 to a score of 5. Some audios will
hold artifacts that we introduced in the tutorial part. Remember to focus more on these artifacts and be more rational
when judging audio. Some grading examples will be provided before the whole test.

<br>

<h2> Section 2</h2>

In this section, there will be a tutorial part, a MOS test and a CMOS test.

<br>
<br>

<b>Tutorial</b>: In this part, you will learn some "advanced artifacts" that you might be encountered in the following
two test parts. Most of their definitions are adapted from Digital Signal Restoration. It will be challenging to learn
these concepts and to identify them in audio, so please be patient.

<br>
<br>

<b>MOS test</b>: In this part, you will be asked to grade 28 samples from a score of 1 to a score of 5. To distinguish
the quality of these audios, you need to be very careful and remember to identify those minor artifacts we introduced in
the tutorial. Some grading examples will be provided before the whole test with a comprehensive explanation.

<br>
<br>

<b>CMOS test</b>: In this part, you will be displayed 12 synthesized sample pairs and be asked to determine which one
sounds better. The ground truth audio will also be provided aside for reference. Some grading examples will be provided
before the whole test with a comprehensive explanation since some audio will be hard to distinguish. -->

<!-- Firstly, there will be one tutorial part:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Common Artifacts in Audio Generation</b>: In this part, you will learn different types of artifacts in audio
        generation. Some test problems will also exist to ensure you have
        understood this prior knowledge.</li>
</ul> -->

<!-- Then, there will be three evaluation parts:
<ul>
    <li> <b>Mean Opinion Score</b>: In every test, you will listen to ONE audio and rate it for naturalness(quality).
        You are expected to conduct 20 listening tests in this part. </li>
    <li> <b>Comparative Mean Opinion Score</b>: In every test, you will listen to TWO audios and rate them for speaker
        similarity.
        You are expected to conduct 20 listening tests in this part.</li>
    <li> <b>ABX Test</b>: In every test, you will listen to TWO audios and rate them for speaker similarity.
        You are expected to conduct 20 listening tests in this part. </li>
</ul> -->
